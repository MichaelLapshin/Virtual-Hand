# Virtual-Hand
A force sensor system which uses machine learning to control a virtual hand.

## First proof-of-concept prototype demonstration:
[Video Link to Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTqG79DlvvM)
- Manual calibration.
- Simple linear correlation between sensor readings and simulated forces.

## Plans for the next version:
- Use a neural network to accurately correlate simulated forces with sensor readings.
