# Virtual-Hand
A force sensor system which uses an AI to control a virtual hand.


# First proof-of-concept prototype demonstration:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTqG79DlvvM
- Manual calibration.
- Simple linear correlation between sensor readings and simulated forces.


# Plans for the next version:
- Use a deep-learning neural network to accurately correlate simulated forces with sensor readings.
